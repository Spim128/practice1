                            But who's to judge the right from wrong.
                            When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
                            That violence breeds violence.
                            But in the end it has to be this way.
                            I've curved my own path, you've followed your wrath;
                            But maybe we're both the same.
                            The world has turned, and so many have burned.
                            But nobody is to blame.
                            It's tearing across this barren wasted land.
                            I feel new life could be born beneath
                            The blood stained sand.</span>
